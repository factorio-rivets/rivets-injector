3. Mods must include source code, and must allow distribution in source code as
    well as compiled form. Where some form of a product is not distributed with
    source code, there must be a well-publicized means of obtaining the source
    code for no more than a reasonable reproduction cost, preferably downloading
    via the Internet without charge. The source code must be the preferred form
    in which a programmer would modify the program. Deliberately obfuscated source
    code is not allowed. Intermediate forms such as the output of a preprocessor
    or translator are not allowed.
